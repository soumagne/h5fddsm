  2011-03-16 Improve tests for static MPI communication
  2011-03-16 Add more support to static MPI inter-communication model - Add UseStaticInterComm option in both H5FDdsmManager and
             H5FDdsmCommMpi - Replace CreateInterComm with ConnectInterCommDSM - Add DSM_STATIC_INTERCOMM option in config file -
             Use MPI_Comm_remote_size instead of doing a send/recv of intercomm sizes
  2011-03-15 Start to add STATIC_COMM option so that global communicator is split between server and client. This option is only
             available for MPI_RMA communication. InterComm is then created to communicate between both intra-communicators. Do
             also some clean up in various other places.
